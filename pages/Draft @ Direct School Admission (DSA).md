<p>### 2023 Direct School Admission (DSA)</p>
<p>#### Public Speaking and Debate @ Whitley Secondary School</p>
<p>&lt;img style="width:80%" src="/images/PublicSpeaking%201.jpeg"&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lights, camera, action! Standing before the audience and articulating
your thoughts have been gaining momentum in our educational landscape and
beyond in the 21st century. Whitley Secondary School has designed a unique
four-year programme called Communicative Arts that aims to equip every
Whitleyan with good communication and critical thinking skills. All incoming
Secondary 1 students build their stage confidence through fun and engaging
dramatic narration through their own stories. Secondary 2 students progress
to build convincing cases for their stand, backed with an arsenal of evidence
through research, and hone their debating skills to further sharpen their
arguments. They are also exposed to writing scripts and presenting as newscasters,
as well as doing post-filming edits, in our Broadcasting Programme. As
critical and lateral thinkers, Secondary 3 students are equipped with an
array of thinking tools to respond to impromptu questions and interact
with the audience persuasively. Bombarded with the myriad of information
online, Secondary 4 students are trained to deconstruct texts, particularly
news or media materials, in order to expose and resist media manipulation,
as well as to use media materials in constructive ways. All the training
and exposure culminate in them delivering a speech on current affairs before
the entire school population where they put across their perspectives and
insights on a piece of news that they are concerned with.</p>
<p>Join us to unlock your potential in becoming effective communicators.
You will be given various platforms – in and out of school – to scale greater
heights of success.</p>

<p>#### Do you have the desire to learn and to grow?</p>
<p>At Whitley Secondary School, the spiral progression approach to learning
is pivotal. Our very own Communicative Arts Programme provides a road map
for you to hone a range of your communicative skills further. Developmental
opportunities – ranging from presenting in the presence of your classmates
and school population to representing the school for competitions – will
enable you to discover and develop the varied talents as you are trained
to think on your feet and respond cogently and confidently. The sense of
discipline instilled will also enhance your academic progress. Whitleyans
have been progressing well, from being mere participants to confident winners
at the national platforms. What are you waiting for? Be part of our family.</p>
<p>#### Who should apply?</p>
<p>If you are keen on developing yourself holistically, possess strong oracy
skills and demonstrate a confidence and passion for speaking, this programme
