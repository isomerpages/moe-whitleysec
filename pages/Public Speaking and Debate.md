<p>Lights, camera, action! Standing before the audience and articulating
your thoughts have been gaining momentum in our educational landscape and
beyond in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. Whitley Secondary School has
designed a unique four-year programme called&nbsp;<em>Communicative Arts</em>&nbsp;that
aims to equip every Whitleyan with good communication and critical thinking
skills. All incoming Secondary 1 students build their stage confidence
through fun and engaging dramatic narration through their own stories.
Secondary 2 students progress to build convincing cases for their stand,
backed with an arsenal of evidence through research, and hone their debating
skills to further sharpen their arguments. They are also exposed to writing
scripts and presenting as newscasters, as well as doing post-filming edits,
in our Broadcasting Programme. As critical and lateral thinkers, Secondary
3 students are equipped with an array of thinking tools to respond to impromptu
questions and interact with the audience persuasively. Bombarded with the
myriad of information online, Secondary 4 students are trained to deconstruct
texts, particularly news or media materials, in order to expose and resist
media manipulation, as well as to use media materials in constructive ways.
All the training and exposure culminate in them delivering a speech on
current affairs before the entire school population where they put across
their perspectives and insights on a piece of news that they are concerned
with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us to unlock your potential in becoming effective communicators.
You will be given various platforms – in and out of school – to scale greater
heights of success. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Do you have the desire to learn and to grow?</strong></h4>
<p>At Whitley Secondary School, the spiral progression approach to learning
is pivotal. Our very own Communicative Arts Programme provides a road map
for you to hone a range of your communicative skills further. Developmental
opportunities – ranging from presenting in the presence of your classmates
and school population to representing the school for competitions – will
enable you to discover and develop the varied talents as you are trained
to think on your feet and respond cogently and confidently. The sense of
discipline instilled will also enhance your academic progress. Whitleyans
have been progressing well, from being mere participants to confident winners
at the national platforms. What are you waiting for? Be part of our family.
