<p>Whitley Secondary School (WSS) is committed to nurturing a caring and
learning community of leaders, who embody the school values of perseverance,
respect, integrity, discipline and empathy. The school firmly believes
that every Whitleyan is a leader and all students have opportunities to
be trained and developed into effective leaders through the 3E1M developmental
approach: Expose (personal leadership); Empower (peer leadership); Excel
(team leadership); and Mentor (community leadership).</p>
<p>At WSS, students can take on different leadership positions: prefects,
CCA leaders, peer support leaders, class leaders, house captains and after-school
engagement leaders. Adopting James Kouzes and Barry Posner’s Leadership
Challenge Model, our student leaders are developed to impact our community
through the demonstration of the five exemplary leadership practices of
modelling the way, inspiring a shared vision, challenging the process,
enabling others to act, and encouraging the heart. In the process, our
student leaders develop self-awareness and sensitivity towards others,
are able to consider different perspectives, grow in empathy and compassion,
build strong resilience, and are better equipped to lead self and others.</p>
<h4><strong>Do you have the desire to lead and to serve?</strong></h4>
<p>At the heart of leadership is the heart of service. At WSS, we nurture
exemplary student leaders who have the heart to care and the will to learn.
You will be given opportunities to plan and organise school events and
values-in-action projects, and to effect changes in student-initiated school
improvement projects. Through a wide range of projects and developmental
opportunities, you will be able to discover your talents and develop your
leadership skills, abilities and character, through discipline, dedication,
teamwork and perseverance.</p>
<p>If you have the desire to lead and serve, join us and be part of our family.</p>
