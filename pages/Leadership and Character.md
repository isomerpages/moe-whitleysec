### Leadership and Character

#### Leadership and Character @ Whitley Secondary School  

<img src="/images/lc1.png" style="width:80%">
  

Whitley Secondary School (WSS) is committed to nurturing a caring and learning community of leaders, who embody the school values of perseverance, respect, integrity, discipline and empathy. The school firmly believes that every Whitleyan is a leader and all students have opportunities to be trained and developed into effective leaders through the 3E1M developmental approach: Expose (personal leadership); Empower (peer leadership); Excel (team leadership); and Mentor (community leadership). 

At WSS, students can take on different leadership positions: prefects, CCA leaders, peer support leaders, class leaders, house captains and after-school engagement leaders. Adopting James Kouzes and Barry Posner’s Leadership Challenge Model, our student leaders are developed to impact our community through the demonstration of the five exemplary leadership practices of modelling the way, inspiring a shared vision, challenging the process, enabling others to act, and encouraging the heart. In the process, our student leaders develop self-awareness and sensitivity towards others, are able to consider different perspectives, grow in empathy and compassion, build strong resilience, and are better equipped to lead self and others. 


  

#### Do you have the desire to lead and to serve?

At the heart of leadership is the heart of service. At WSS, we nurture exemplary student leaders who have the heart to care and the will to learn. You will be given opportunities to plan and organise school events and values-in-action projects, and to effect changes in student-initiated school improvement projects. Through a wide range of projects and developmental opportunities, you will be able to discover your talents and develop your leadership skills, abilities and character, through discipline, dedication, teamwork and perseverance. 

If you have the desire to lead and serve, join us and be part of our family.
