Lights, camera, action! Standing before the audience and articulating your thoughts have been gaining momentum in our educational landscape and beyond in the 21st century. Whitley Secondary School has designed a unique four-year programme called Communicative Arts that aims to equip every Whitleyan with good communication and critical thinking skills. All incoming Secondary 1 students build their stage confidence through fun and engaging drama. They become budding stars who jump into acting with a convincing portrayal of their characters, bringing the story to life. Secondary 2 students progress to build convincing cases for their stand, backed with an arsenal of evidence through research, and hone their debating skills to further sharpen their arguments. They are also exposed to writing scripts and presenting as newscasters, as well as doing post-filming edits, in our Broadcasting Programme. As critical and lateral thinkers, Secondary 3 students are equipped with an array of thinking tools to respond to impromptu questions and interact with the audience persuasively. Bombarded with the myriad of information online, Secondary 4 students are trained to deconstruct texts, particularly news or media materials, in order to expose and resist media manipulation, as well as to use media materials in constructive ways. All the training and exposure culminate in them delivering a speech on current affairs before the entire school population where they put across their perspectives and insights on a piece of news that they are concerned with.

  

Join us to unlock your potential in becoming effective communicators. You will be given various platforms – in and out of school – to scale greater heights of success.

  

#### Do you have the desire to learn and to grow?

At Whitley Secondary School, the spiral progression approach to learning is pivotal. Our very own Communicative Arts Programme provides a road map for you to hone a range of your communicative skills further. Developmental opportunities – ranging from presenting in the presence of your classmates and school population to representing the school for competitions – will enable you to discover and develop the varied talents as you are trained to think on your feet and respond cogently and confidently. The sense of discipline instilled will also enhance your academic progress. Whitleyans have been progressing well, from being mere participants to confident winners at the national platforms. What are you waiting for? Be part of our family.

  

#### Who should apply?

If you are keen on developing yourself holistically, possess strong oracy skills and demonstrate a confidence and passion for speaking, this programme is for you.

  

The following will be our criteria for selection:

*   Students with very good conduct
*   Experiences pertinent to public speaking or debating in the presence of audience
*   An interview to determine suitability (no experience required)
    
    \- To deliver a 3-minute prepared speech on any social issue or story
    
    \- To speak on an impromptu topic during the interview
    

*   Your achievements at the national / international level would be an advantage

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

  

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.

  

DSA is a commitment on the part of both the student and the secondary school. The school is committed to developing DSA-admitted students to their fullest potential in both their studies and areas of talent throughout their school years. Therefore, students who are not sure or not ready to do so should enter a secondary school through the S1 Posting Exercise instead.
