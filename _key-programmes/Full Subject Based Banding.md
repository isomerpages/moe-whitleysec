Full Subject Based Banding
==========================

Whitley was one of the pilot schools to implement FSBB in 2021. With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, removing the labels of streaming classes into Express, Normal Academic and Normal Technical. Instead, within one class, there will be students from all 3 streams with different subject bands, to better meet our studentsâ€™ learning needs. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life. For Secondary 1 students joining our school, form classes will be set up with the spirit and intent of FSBB and incorporating learners of different profiles. There will also be some subjects like Physical Education, Art, Music, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education and Character and Citizenship Education that will be designed to deliver a common learning experience for all, and in doing so create a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.
