Cross Country
=============

Cross Country Run at Macritchie Reservoir
-----------------------------------------

Every year Whitley Secondary School will take part in the Cross Country Run. Students in their various Houses will run and compete with each other. This was a great opportunity for everyone to experience the outdoors and take part in some physical activity. We hope students will develop healthy habits and be encouraged to take up running or jogging.
