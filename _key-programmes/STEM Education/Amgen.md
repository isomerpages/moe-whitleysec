The Amgen Biotech Experience
----------------------------

The Amgen Biotech Experience is an eye-opening innovation programme that offers our students the exciting and invaluable opportunity to broaden their horizons in the field of research. As part of the schoolâ€™s push to promote a good educational foundation for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, the school has partnered with Science Centre and Amgen Inc to provide this meaningful programme, enhancing and complementing the overall quality of science research education in Whitley Secondary.

  

Our students certainly jumped at the opportunity to use research grade equipment in conducting experiments with real-world relevance. They had the chance to be guided in, and try their hand at core genetic engineering techniques such as micro-pipetting, gel electrophoresis, and bacterial transformation. Besides providing authentic and engaging experiences in the laboratory for our students, the programme inculcates an increased awareness of common lifestyle diseases such as diabetes. Students discuss and learn about how these lifestyle diseases can be possibly treated, and how genetic engineering plays a key role in providing affordable treatment for diabetic patients, among others. As a mainstay of our Science programme, the Amgen Biotech Experience will continue to introduce our students to the wonders of scientific discovery in years to come.
