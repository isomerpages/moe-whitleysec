STEM Education
==============

As part of our holistic approach to teach and prepare students for the future. Whitley Secondary School promotes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education with programmes such as the Amgen Programme, Environment Week and MicroBit. STEM teaching and learning goes beyond the mere transfer of knowledge. It should engage students and equip them with critical thinking, problem solving, creative and collaborative skills, and ultimately establish connections between the school, work place, community and the global economy.
