Environment Week
================

The theme for Environment Week 2021 (5th - 9th April 2021) was a “Year of Climate Action: Zero Wastage” and true to the spirit of zero wastage, an array of activities took place to raise awareness of climate change, all centered around creative methods to reduce waste. Throughout the week, Whitleyans had the chance to learn more about organic waste management from our knowledgeable vendors, and our Green Ambassadors even had the opportunity to turn organic food waste into their very own Eco Enzyme cleaning solution - how ingenious!

  

Some highlights of the week also included a sale of an array of eco-friendly items, and much to our students' curiosity, a booth on Black Soldier Flies, helmed by Otolith Enrichment. The booth greatly intrigued many students; after all, who would have thought that flies could upcycle Singapore's food waste into rich fertilisers?

  

It was definitely a fruitful week of learning, and this could not have been made possible without the assistance of the Science Department teachers, Laboratory Technicians, Singapore Environment Council, National Environment Agency, Team Sports Marketing (Sale of eco friendly items), and Otolith Enrichment (Black Soldier Fly booth). Our students and staff alike have certainly been encouraged to make individual and collective efforts to bring about Zero wastage.
