Micro:Bit
=========

Whitley Secondary School Lower Secondary students had the wonderful opportunity to explore the world of science and technology. The school aims to instil passion for technology among Whitleyans, and develop in students an interest in programming. Thus the school introduced the Micro:Bit programme that allows students to build and customize their own simple pocket-size codeable computer.

  

The Secondary 1 students were taught a core set of basic Micro:Bit programming skills and exposed to several prototype products. The students would then use the basic skills taught to create one game-based product. The students would then compete among themselves to create the best game-based product.

  

The Secondary 2 students went through a refresher course on Micro:Bit and were introduced to Micro:Bit external accessories such as the motor pumps, LED lighting modules, the motion, sound, light, temperature and rain sensors. Students would also go through an Ideation process, using their knowledge of Micro:Bit and the accessories to submit a project proposal to the teacher-in-charge for approval. Students would use some of these accessories to create a useful product for themselves.

  

Our students YEO HUI MING, LISA from 3E3 (2020) and MA YUHENG from 3E1 (2020) participated in the IDE (Innovation, Design and Engineering) Makers Competition in November 2020. Their Micro:Bit team named Mandata created a project that showcased the use of Micro:Bit and accessories to develop a plant watering system that taps on the use of recycled water. They showcased their work via a short video and a Zoom presentation on 30 October 2020 and came in 2nd runner-up.
