**CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION@WSS**  
  
  
**Purpose**

Racial Harmony Day
------------------

Our students learned and shared about key contemporary social issues. One of these was to look at radicalization and how we can go about weaving the threads of cohesion in our society through the use of The Straits Time IN. As part of reflection, we got our students to pen it down on Padlet, a new ICT platform for them to share their thoughts.
