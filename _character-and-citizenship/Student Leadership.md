Whitleyans have endless opportunities to develop their leadership skills. The Whitley Student Leadership Development committee prides itself in developing every Whitleyan to be a leader - one who embodies the school values of perseverance, responsibility, integrity, discipline and empathy. The student leaders have many opportunities to develop their leadership qualities and skills.
