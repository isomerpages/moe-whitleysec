### NATIONAL / CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

**CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION@WSS**  
  
  
**Purpose**  

*   In Whitley, we believe that Citizenship Education (CE) plays an important role in nurturing future citizens, to inspire in our young a sense of belonging to the nation, and guide them to be knowledgeable about local and global issues.

  

*   This develops our young to better understand, appreciate and commit to their role as responsible and caring citizens, and be loyal to the nation.

  
**The WSS Citizenship Education is guided by the following key dispositions:**

#### Racial Harmony Day

Our students learned and shared about key contemporary social issues. One of these was to look at radicalization and how we can go about weaving the threads of cohesion in our society through the use of The Straits Time IN. As part of reflection, we got our students to pen it down on Padlet, a new ICT platform for them to share their thoughts.
