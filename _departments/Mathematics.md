<p>The Mathematics Department believes in enabling students to acquire mathematical
concepts and skills for continuous learning in Mathematics. To supplement
our meaningful and engaging lessons, we have introduced a Whitley Maths
Talent Programme to stretch our students and help them explore the world
of Mathematics. It is a developmental programme that caters to our Secondary
One, Two and Three students who have demonstrated a strong grasp of the
subject. In this programme, students are exposed to an advanced and enriched
curriculum to stretch their learning. Students are also given the opportunity
to participate in both National and International Mathematics Competitions.
In spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were events and competitions that
were held online. We hope this would help our students enjoy Mathematics
better and make it part of their lives.</p>
