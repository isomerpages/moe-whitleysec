Mathematics
===========

The Mathematics Department believes in enabling students to acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in Mathematics. To supplement our meaningful and engaging lessons, we have introduced a Whitley Maths Talent Programme to stretch our students and help them explore the world of Mathematics. It is a developmental programme that caters to our Secondary One, Two and Three students who have demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject. In this programme, students are exposed to an advanced and enriched curriculum to stretch their learning. Students are also given the opportunity to participate in both National and International Mathematics Competitions. In spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were events and competitions that were held online. We hope this would help our students enjoy Mathematics better and make it part of their lives.
