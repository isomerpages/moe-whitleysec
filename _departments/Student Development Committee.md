<p>Character &amp; Citizenship Education Department Whitley Secondary School
adopts a holistic approach to Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE).
CCE lessons focus on the explicit teaching of values and social-emotional
competencies to address the holistic developmental needs of students, and
this is complemented by guided opportunities for reinforcement and application
of learning. Our lessons aim to equip students with relevant knowledge
and skills to better understand real-world contexts, including understanding
mental health issues, navigating cyber spaces responsibly, making appropriate
educational and career choices, appreciating family life and understanding
Singaporeâ€™s racial and religious diversity.</p>
<p>This is done by providing platforms for discussions on contemporary issues
to enable our students to grasp current realities in our personal, national,
regional, and global contexts, and inspire them to make a positive difference
to the people and world around them. Multiple learning platforms are tapped
on to help students internalise values, social-emotional competencies,
and citizenship dispositions. Beyond weekly CCE lessons, these platforms
include key Student Development Experiences (SDEs), which are programmes
and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our
students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral, and social domains.
These experiences are delivered through level-wide programmes such as:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Education (NE) Commemorative Days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) / Cohort Camps;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programmes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) / Active Citizenship for Social Change (ACSC) programmes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from the implementation of CCE learning experiences, the CCE and
Student Development Teams work hand-in-hand with the rest of the school
to ensure that students have a caring environment, where they feel safe
and empowered by fostering positive teacher-student and peer relationships.
Through all of this, we develop our students to become future-ready and
self-directed learners who empathise and demonstrate care for the community.</p>
