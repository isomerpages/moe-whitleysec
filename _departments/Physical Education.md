<p>Whitley Secondary School’s Physical Education Department aims to develop
students’ learning capacity to be fit and healthy students who are resilient
and adventurous. We believe in teaching our students to learn and adopt
life-long healthy habits and that Physical Education is an integral part
of the holistic development of every child. We seek to educate our students
on overall fitness and wellness, develop games proficiency and learn important
values such as teamwork, resilience and grit through sports.</p>
<p>Besides subscribing to the PE Curriculum, various other robust and engaging
programmes are organised to arouse the students’ interest and to encourage
participation.</p>
<p>At the end of their journey in Whitley, we strongly believe all Whitleyans
will be able to enjoy outdoor activities and appreciate a variety of sports
and games. Through the activities, students will also develop values such
as teamwork and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>In spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, we were very fortunate to be able to
carry out the modified level camp for the secondary 1 to 3 levels. For
secondary 1 and 2 students, it was a 3- day non residential camp where
the students were treated to adventure based learning which they really
enjoyed. Activities like kayaking, dragon boat, orienteering, outdoor cooking
and amazing race.</p>
<p>As for the secondary 3 students, they were privileged to attend the 2
day Outward Bound Camp in Punggol, East Coast Park and Pulau Ubin area.
They too had a great time immersing themselves in the outdoors leading
to the experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Whitley Secondary School was also responsible for organising the South
7 Cluster Games. Whitley Secondary School students were very keen to participate
in the football, badminton and basketball games organized at the cluster
level. This event provided a good platform for the students to have a more
meaningful engagement during this period.</p>
<p>To further promote student fitness, the school also organized the All-Children
Exercise Simultaneous Day@ WSS – Mass Dance. With the support of the PE/Sports
Leaders, all students and staff carried out this mass dance in their respective
classes due to the Covid-19 safety restrictions.</p>
