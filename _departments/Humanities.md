<p>Whitley Secondary School Humanities Department teachers are committed
to helping our students succeed in and broaden the horizons of their learning.
Our History, Social Studies, Geography and Principles of Accounts teachers
care for our students’ well-being and strive to make their learning enjoyable,
meaningful and authentic by promoting experiential learning and relating
their learning to contemporary world issues and events. Through our Humanities
curriculum, we aim to inculcate strong citizenship values and develop students’
critical and analytical thinking skills. Furthermore, student collaboration
and peer learning is strongly valued, and promoted through group projects
and relevant pedagogical approaches such as the Structured Inquiry Cycle
&amp; Deliberation process.</p>
<p>For 2021, all Whitley Secondary 1-3 students have their own personal learning
device. To tap on this effectively, our Department adopted and promoted
the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to supplement
our Home-Based Learning lessons and to make learning more engaging in the
classroom. Through the use of the Student Learning Space (SLS), Google
Classroom, YouTube videos, Zoom meetings, Microsoft Teams and many other
novel ICT tools, the department’s teachers helped to ensure the continuous
teaching, learning and engagement of students in the Humanities in spite
of the Covid-19 pandemic. This exposure to using ICT tools is subsequently
brought into the classroom, where our Humanities students are guided to
employ these to collaborate with one another. This enhances their self-directed
learning alongside developing expertise in using technology.</p>
<p>The department also believes that learning is made fun through hands-on
experience. We seek to develop and stretch our students via experiential
learning journeys, fieldwork projects, conferences and competitions. However
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we had to adapt many of our usual outdoor
experiential learning opportunities to various online platforms. Nevertheless,
our students still got the valued chance to explore Kent Ridge and the
National Museum. While some of our annual Humanities Talent Development
programmes such as competitions and conferences, were temporarily postponed
due to safety concerns our students were exposed to a wide range of online
platforms and games such as IntelliCount for their Principles of Accounts.
Through this wide range of engaging methods and activities, our students
continue effectively on their goal of developing critical thinking through
a well-rounded and authentic education in the Humanities.</p>
