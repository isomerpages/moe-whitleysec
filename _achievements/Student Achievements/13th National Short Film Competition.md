Aug 2021: Congratulations to a team of 6 Sec 3 HCL students for clinching 3rd prize for the 13th National Short Film Competition. They have learnt valuable media production skills during the pre-competition workshops and applied what they have learnt to produce an original short video clip, titled "丹顶鹤”. The video touches on the issue of bullying and the importance of peer support. See video:
