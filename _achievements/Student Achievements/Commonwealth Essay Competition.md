### Commonwealth Essay Competition

<img src="/images/cec1.png" style="width:80%">

The Queen's Commonwealth Essay Competition (QCEC) is the world's oldest international schools' writing contest, established in 1883. Each year, entrants write on a theme that explores the Commonwealth's values, fostering an empathetic world view in the next generation of leaders and encouraging young people to consider new perspectives to the challenges that the world faces. Themes have included the environment, community, inclusion, the role of youth leadership, and gender equality. In 2022, the competition theme was 'Our Commonwealth', reflecting on Queen Elizabeth II's seven decades of service to the Commonwealth.

  

2022 saw a record-breaking 26,322 entries to the QCEC from every Commonwealth region, with the winners and runners-up from New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, India and Singapore.  We are pleased to share that the following Whitleyeans have received certificates of participation, bronze, silver and gold awards.
