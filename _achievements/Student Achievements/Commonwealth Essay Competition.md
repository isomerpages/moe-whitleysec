<p>The Queen's Commonwealth Essay Competition (QCEC) is the world's oldest
international schools' writing contest, established in 1883. Each year,
entrants write on a theme that explores the Commonwealth's values, fostering
an empathetic world view in the next generation of leaders and encouraging
young people to consider new perspectives to the challenges that the world
faces. Themes have included the environment, community, inclusion, the
role of youth leadership, and gender equality. In 2024, the competition
asks entrants to consider how they deal with adversity, and how community
and culture can be used to encourage resilience and hope in a world with
a growing number of global issues.â€¯</p>
<p>This year, there were a record-breaking 34,939 entries from all Commonwealth
regions, with the winners and runners-up from New Zealand, Australia, the
United Kingdom, India and Singapore. We are pleased to share that our school
has achieved 42 Bronze, 34 Silver, and 6 Gold Awards.</p>
