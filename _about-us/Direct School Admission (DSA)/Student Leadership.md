<h4><strong>2025 DSA - Student Leadership Whitley Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>At Whitley Secondary school, we firmly believe in the importance of student
leadership as reflected in our school mission: “To nurture Whitleyans to
be Exemplary Leaders with the Heart to Care and the Will to Learn”. The
Student Leadership Committee seeks to develop every Whitleyan to be a leader
who embodies the school values of <em>Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy</em>,
and has the passion for the community and heart to serve others.</p>
<h4><strong>Student Leadership Opportunities</strong></h4>
<p>The table below outlines the formal leadership opportunities that are
available to students that they can use to challenge themselves.</p>

<h4><strong>Growth Model for Student Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>Students who assume formal leadership roles will undergo and participate
in intentionally designed learning experiences to equip and challenge them
as they grow as a leader. Some instances include workshops to hone new
skills (such as facilitation techniques), leadership camps and/or dialogue
sessions.</p>
<p>Students will learn the 5 practices of exemplary leaders and will be encouraged
to apply these practices in their leadership journey. Throughout their
leadership journey, regular review sessions will be held to provide students
with the opportunity to reflect on their leadership experiences, assess
their progress, manage their responsibilities, and celebrate their achievements.
Not only will these experiences shape the attitudes, beliefs and actions
of the student leaders, it also provides them with opportunities to develop
their social-emotional competencies as they grow in self-awareness and
learn how to manage relationships. They will also grow in their emerging
21<sup>st</sup> century competencies such as critical, adaptive and inventive
thinking.</p>
