Secondary 1 Camp
================

Our Secondary 1 students were delighted to participate in their first school camp (Camp Connect) in Whitley from the 3rd to the 5th of March 2021. What awaited them was an extensive selection of electrifying activities, beginning in school itself: our young students were challenged with a series of team-building games such as archery tag, Highest Tower, and Mission Impossible. Working with their new classmates, they tackled these games with gusto, and eventually overcame them as a united team.

  

Our students also had the chance to embark on a History Trail at Kent Ridge Park. Amidst the refreshing air and greenery, our students learnt valuable historical lessons about the Japanese invasion and occupation of Singapore. They also participated in an Amazing Race, where they worked together to decipher clues to various locations. Through ingenuity and responsible decision-making, our teams were able to complete the race successfully.

  

The most highly-anticipated activity was the Dragon Boating experience. Students learnt that the skill of paddling in coordination was not as easy as it seemed! Yet, with perseverance, grit, and laughter, the entire endeavour turned out to be a memorable day under the afternoon sun for them. Afterwards, the students were rewarded with a huge campfire in the middle of our parade square, cheering and dancing throughout the evening, and leaving with satisfied minds, grateful hearts, toughened spirits and new friendships forged.
