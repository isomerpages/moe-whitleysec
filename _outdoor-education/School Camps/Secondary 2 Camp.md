Secondary 2 Camp
================

Our Secondary 2 students participated in Camp Outreach from 3 to 5 March 2021. It was a camp that the cohort had excitedly looked forward to for a long time! During these three days, our students enjoyed a range of thrilling and meaningful activities all around the island, while demonstrating responsible decision making towards self, others and the community and environment.

  

One of the challenges facing them was an invigorating trek from the visitor centre of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to Hillview Nature Park. Undaunted, all of our students persevered and completed the route, with some classes even continuing on to Wallace Education Centre or to Singapore Quarry to take in the breathtaking scenery.

  

Elsewhere, at Home TeamNS Bukit Batok, our students were taught elements of camp craft, such as fire starting and shelter building. To succeed at these, our students learnt how to show respect and listen to one another. Back in school, our students participated in many team-building games such as human foosball and archery tag. Some were even joined by their teachers! Amidst the fun, our students also found the time and effort to contribute back to the community by embarking on a beach clean-up at East Coast Park. Through these activities, the students could reflect on their own strengths and the relationships with their peers and the wider community.

  

At PA Sembawang, our students enthusiastically took to the water in their rafts and kayaks. These water activities aimed to orientate students with the necessary paddling skills. The students loved this activity, and some students were reluctant to leave the water. The Camp culminated in a series of mini-campfires across the venues, where they shared their learning, experiences and bonded with each other over the warm smell of freshly-toasted marshmallows. The students told us it was a great experience for them!
