Secondary 4 & 5 Camp
====================

The Motivational and Study Camp for our Sec 4s and 5s was held from 3rd to 5th March. Through active learning, the 4E5N programme aimed to inculcate our graduating students with crucial study and time management skills, and also help them to discover their own strengths and weaknesses through introspection. Moreover, the camp aimed to prepare our students to be future ready by gaining valuable guidance for interview skills and portfolio building.

  

To this end, there were dialogues organised with various post-secondary education institutions: the 4E5N cohort had a face-to-face sharing and Q&A with representatives from Republic Polytechnic, and Zoom sessions were held with Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic. Through these, the participants learnt more about the various courses offered as well as EAE requirements. Seniors from ACJC, CJC, and JC were also invited to share their experiences and insights into Junior College life.

  

The 4N(A) classes went on a journey to the revamped Funan Centre, which offered them a new understanding of how new technologies can and has helped to shape the new Funan Centre, and how such technologies can be applied to the conceptualisation and propagation of new businesses. Moreover, mock interviews were also conducted to help our students prepare for their EAE applications in a structured manner.

  

As part of their camp programme, 4C also participated in the structured mock interview practice. They also got to find out more about their own personal profiles, and learn more about the range of ITE courses available. All of them were engaged as their trainer shared his own personal ITE experience! Through this camp, our Sec 4 and 5s developed their confidence, self-worth, and initiative and we hope that our students were inspired to take responsibility for their own learning, and strive for excellence!
