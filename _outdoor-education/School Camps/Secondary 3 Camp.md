Secondary 3 Camp
================

Our spirited Secondary 3 students embarked on the MOE-OBS Challenge programme (4th to 5th Mar 2021) at various exciting locations around the island. This adventurous outdoor experience aimed to build our students' resilience through multiple opportunities that tested their ability to overcome unfamiliar challenges, team settings, and the environments.

  

For the Sea Expedition segment of the challenge, our students endured the harsh sun in their kayaks and inflatable rubber boats, working together to overcome the adversity of navigating the waters. The programme also aimed to inculcate the values expected of a concerned and conscientious citizen by involving them in a service project to help improve or maintain the environment. For their Land Expedition, some of our students trekked across Coney Island to explore environmental issues, while others participated in a coastal cleanup to save marine life. They were also introduced to minimal impact camping ethics, local heritage and biodiversity to better appreciate the environment they are in.

  

Through these encouraging experiences, our Secondary 3 students not only learnt how to make the right choices to influence their circumstances, but also forged lasting bonds with their new classmates. At the end of the programme, there were tired but beaming faces all around as the students proudly received their certificates of completion from their facilitators.
